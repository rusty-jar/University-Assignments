# University-Assignments Code of Conduct

As the sole contributor of the University-Assignments repository, I am committed to fostering a respectful and inclusive environment for everyone involved. I value diversity, open-mindedness, and constructive collaboration.

In this project, I pledge to:

- Treat all individuals with respect, kindness, and empathy.
- Encourage a safe and harassment-free space for discussions and interactions.
- Embrace diverse perspectives, experiences, and ideas.
- Be open to feedback and constructive criticism.
- Refrain from engaging in any form of discrimination, harassment, or offensive behavior.

If anyone observes behavior that violates this Code of Conduct, I kindly request that you bring it to my attention by opening an issue or contacting me directly. I will address the issue promptly and take appropriate action to maintain a positive environment.

By participating in this project, you agree to abide by this Code of Conduct.

Thank you for your cooperation in creating a welcoming and inclusive atmosphere.
